# **App Name**: MotionVerse

## Core Features:

- Loading Screen: A black screen with a large number counting from 0 to 100, then fading away like smoke.
- Metallic Sphere Intro: A metallic mercury sphere appears in the center with subtle wave-like surface movements and neon reflections.
- Typographic Parallax: Text elements (MOTION / THAT / MATTERS) move left and right at different speeds on the first scroll, deforming the mercury sphere.
- Liquid Transformation: The sphere transforms into a boiling mercury mass that reacts to mouse movements. Project list fades in with a blur effect.
- Interactive Project List: Minimalist project list with project name and year. Hovering transforms the background mercury into a flat disk, shows a video preview next to the mouse, and changes the mercury reflection color to match the project theme.
- Cinematic Project Overlay: Clicking a project expands a rectangle to full screen, plays the project video, and displays project information with a type-on animation. Includes a back/close button that appears on scroll.
- Minimal Contact Transition: At the end of the scroll, the liquid mercury shrinks into a shining point on the 'GET IN TOUCH' button.
